1.The "wind_data" folder contains all necessary wind field data (wind speed).

2.Open "Main_CalculateMean" in MATLAB, located within the "data_visualize" folder. Copy the data for a specific velocity into the same folder as "Main_CalculateMean." Choose the start and end times, then calculate the average value of the data from a single list.

3.If you have values from different lists, input them into "data_collection." Click "run" to obtain the distribution of average velocity across the plane.

4.Similar to step 3, input the values into "data_deal" to generate contour plots and horizontal & vertical sectional drawings.

5.Similar to step 3, input the values into "error_analysis" to generate contour plots and horizontal & vertical sectional drawings of the error.

6.Copy the wind speed file into the "temporal_verification" folder. Rename the file as "**mps_y*". Replace "**mps" in the corresponding code to obtain the temporal verification of wind speed.
